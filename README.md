# WDIO basic

Welcome to one of my backup storage. this repositories will be about the sample of how to write webdriverIO. This isn't the perfect way to write the script test using webdriverIO, but let's just say it's one of so many form of writting your webdriverIO. I will try to update this repositories when I feel like it.

### Note
- Every humans have the freedom to writte their codes, but make sure it still understandable for your team ðŸ˜‰
- Before starting, make sure you already install the basic tools like node, etc
- Be careful if your browser autoupdate is active. Sometimes webdriver(chromedriver, geckodriver, etc) isn't updated as soon the latest browser is released.

## Step to use using git clone
- open terminal/powershell/cmd/any
- move to your desired directory in your local machine
- clone this repositories
- run 'npm install'
- then you can try this script using command 'npm run test'

## step to write from scratch
I apologise, but believe me it's better if you just ask AI chat ðŸ¤£
