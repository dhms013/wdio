# WDIO basic

Welcome to one of my backup storage. this repositories will be about the sample of how to write webdriverIO. This isn't the perfect way to write the script test using webdriverIO, but let's just say it's one of so many form of writting your webdriverIO. I will try to update this repositories when I feel like it.

### Note
- This test feature include screenshot error when you find bugs, and automatically open report when all your test finished
- Every humans have the freedom to writte their codes, but make sure it still understandable for your team ðŸ˜‰
- Before starting, make sure you already install the basic tools like node, etc
- Be careful if your browser autoupdate is active. Sometimes driver from webdriverIO(chromedriver, geckodriver, etc) isn't updated as soon the latest browser is released.
- This repository is testing the "https://www.saucedemo.com/" pages
- I saved the credentials inside '.env' file. So you need to make one if you want to try my codes

## Step to use using git clone
- open terminal/powershell/cmd/any
- move to your desired directory in your local machine
- clone this repository
- move your terminal directory to the clonned repository
- run 'npm install'
- then you can try this script using command 'npm run test'

I apologise, but believe me it's better if you just ask AI chat ðŸ¤£
